# Documentation Planning Implementation
Before programming the game, it was decided which classes, methods and attributes would most likely be needed. <br>
All classes, methods and attributes are also named in the respective GitHub issues.

Initial structure:
<!-- insert class diagram -->
![Diagram](class-diagram.png)
The necessary parts for the game were divided in individual classes. Required attributes and methods are mapped in the diagram. As the diagram only shows the first idea, the relations and structure in the finished game may differ from the original structure.
